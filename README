yal-lin is a fast stochastic local search (SLS) SAT solver that implements an weight transferring algorithm.

yal-lin is developed on top of Yalsat. Algorithms, Implmentation, and Experiments are presented in our NFM-2023 paper "A Linear Weight Transfer Rule for Local Search" (Md Solimul Chowdhury, Cayden Codel, Marijn Heule)
